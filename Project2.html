            <h2>About this Project: </h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This project originated during the COVID-19 pandemic, which obstructed onsite learning. Recognizing the problem that students might not be fully engaged in remote learning. Therefore, I developed this project to address this issue by checking students from the screen during online classes.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Online learning assistance project was created by using Python for implementing the Face-Detection system and GUI. For the front-end, website display uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At that time, I was no knowledge in back-end development and databases, so Google Sheet was used for data storage.
